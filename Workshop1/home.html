  Hi!

  I am YOUR NAME HERE and this is my picture

  <!-- put your picture here -->

  Welcome to the homepage of my website. I am learning HTML!

  I can make bold statements, like:

  "I am an HTML expert!"

  Tags I know

  Here is a list of tags that I learned so far:

  h1 to h6 for headings of 6 different levels, h1 being the biggest and h6 being the smallest
  p for paragraphs
  ul for unordered lists
  ol for ordered lists
  and li for their list items
  strong for strong statements in bold text
  em for emphasis in italics
  a for links, and I know how to use the href attribute
  and img for images, they have a src attribute and no closing tag.
